## üß† Core Game Logic (`tictactoe.py` content)

This module contains all the game rules and the AI's decision-making logic, including the Minimax implementation and its helper functions.

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `initial_state()` | Returns a standard, empty $3 \times 3$ board. |
| `player(board)` | Returns the player (`X` or `O`) whose turn is next. |
| `actions(board)` | Lists all currently **available** legal moves as $(row, col)$ tuples. |
| `result(board, action)` | Creates a **deep copy** of the board and applies the move, returning the new state. |
| `winner(board)` | Checks rows, columns, and diagonals, returning the winning player (`X` or `O`), or `None`. |
| `terminal(board)` | Checks if the game is over (a win for either side, or a full board draw). |
| `utility(board)` | Assigns a numerical value to a final state: **1** (X win), **-1** (O win), or **0** (tie). |
| `minimax(board)` | **The AI function.** Searches the game tree to find and return the move that guarantees the best score. |
| `maxValue(board)` | Helper function used by Minimax to find the best outcome for the **Maximizing Player (X)**. |
| `minValue(board)` | Helper function used by Minimax to find the best outcome for the **Minimizing Player (O)**. |
